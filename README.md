# map-project

The neighborhood map project displays a map of Milwaukee and some of my favorite restaurant/coffeeshop locations.

To run the app, download the repository and open index.html.

To filter the map, begin typing in the search bar. Matching locations will remain in both the list and as markers on the map.

This project uses the Google Maps API to display the map and the Flickr API to display an image when the user clicks on a marker.
It also uses the Foundation CSS framework for the responsive grid. All other sources are cited in within the files.
